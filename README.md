# jest-tests README

This repository contains a VS Code extension (generated with `yo code`) but with the integration test suite runner replaced. By default, the generated project uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), but if you already have [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or you want to migrate to it, it can be difficult.

The important bits came from this issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test/issues/37 and this blog post: https://medium.com/@soloydenko/end-to-end-testing-vs-code-extensions-via-jest-828e5edfeb75.

## This is not intended to be maintained

You can always open issues to ask question, but don't waste your time on PR unless asked (or told it would be worth it).
